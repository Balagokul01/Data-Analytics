Iris Pattern Recognition with Pandas and Sciklearn 

This repository contains a Python script for performing Iris pattern recognition using the Pandas library for data manipulation and the Scikit-Learn library for machine learning. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset for practicing classification tasks. In this project, we will classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements.

Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Python (3.x recommended)
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
Numpy
